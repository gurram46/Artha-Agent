# User Data Storage Implementation Summary

## Overview
Artha AI implements a comprehensive user data storage system that handles user profiles, chat history, and financial data with security and privacy in mind.

## User Data Storage Components

### 1. User Profile Storage
**Location**: `backend/models/user_models.py`

**Data Stored**:
- **Personal Information**:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Phone Number
  - Date of Birth
  - Occupation

- **Professional Information**:
  - Occupation Details
  - Annual Income
  - Work Experience
  - Industry

- **Investment Preferences**:
  - Risk Tolerance
  - Investment Goals
  - Investment Horizon
  - Preferred Assets

**Storage Method**: File-based JSON storage in `user_data/` directory
**File Format**: `{user_id}.json`

### 2. Chat History Storage
**Location**: `backend/services/chat_service.py`

**Data Stored**:
- Chat conversations with unique IDs
- Individual messages with timestamps
- User context and financial data (encrypted)
- Chat analytics and feedback

**Storage Method**: SQLite database with encrypted financial data
**Security Features**:
- User ID hashing for privacy
- Financial data encryption using AES
- Secure database connections

### 3. Database Models
**Location**: `backend/database/chat_models.py`

**Tables**:
- `ChatConversation`: Stores conversation metadata
- `ChatMessage`: Stores individual messages
- `ChatAnalytics`: Tracks usage patterns
- `ChatFeedback`: Stores user feedback

### 4. User Authentication & Sessions
**Location**: `backend/services/auth_service.py`

**Features**:
- User profile retrieval
- Session management
- Authentication state tracking

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Encryption
- Financial data is encrypted before database storage
- Uses AES encryption for sensitive information
- Encryption keys are managed securely

### 2. User Privacy
- User IDs are hashed using SHA-256
- Personal data is stored separately from chat data
- No plain-text storage of sensitive information

### 3. Database Security
- Connection pooling with pre-ping validation
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Automatic table creation and migration

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - User provides personal and professional information
   - Data is validated using Pydantic models
   - Profile is saved as JSON file with unique user ID

2. **Chat Interactions**:
   - Each conversation gets a unique ID
   - Messages are stored with timestamps
   - Financial context is encrypted before storage
   - User ID is hashed for privacy

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - User profiles are loaded from JSON files
   - Chat history is retrieved from database
   - Financial data is decrypted on retrieval

## Storage Locations

- **User Profiles**: `user_data/{user_id}.json`
- **Chat Database**: SQLite database (configured in `database/config.py`)
- **Logs**: Application logs with user activity

## Data Retention

- User profiles are retained until manually deleted
- Chat history is stored indefinitely for service improvement
- Users can request data deletion through the profile interface

## Compliance & Privacy

- Data is stored locally on the server
- No third-party data sharing without consent
- Users have control over their data through profile management
- Encryption ensures data security even if storage is compromised

## API Endpoints for Data Management

- `POST /api/user/profile` - Create/Update user profile
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Retrieve user profile
- `DELETE /api/user/profile` - Delete user data
- `GET /api/chat/history` - Retrieve chat history
- `POST /api/chat/message` - Store new chat message

## Backup & Recovery

- User profile files can be easily backed up
- Database can be exported/imported
- Encryption keys should be backed up separately
- Regular automated backups recommended for production

This implementation ensures secure, private, and efficient storage of all user data while maintaining easy access for the application's functionality.
