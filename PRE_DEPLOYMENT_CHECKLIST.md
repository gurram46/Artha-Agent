# Pre-Deployment Checklist for Artha AI

## 🔒 Critical Security Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

### ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Security Middleware**: Comprehensive security middleware implemented
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Enhanced rate limiting with Redis support
- [x] **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation middleware
- [x] **Account Lockout**: Account lockout mechanism implemented
- [x] **Session Management**: Secure server-side session management created
- [x] **Context API**: Complete state management refactor

### 🚨 CRITICAL - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
- [ ] **Local Storage Security**: Migrate all sensitive data from localStorage to secure sessions
  - **Status**: Session service created, AppContext updated, but needs testing
  - **Action**: Test the session migration and ensure all localStorage usage is replaced
  - **Files**: `frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`, `frontend/src/services/sessionService.ts`

## 🧪 Testing Requirements (CRITICAL)

### ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Test Infrastructure**: Jest configuration and test setup created
- [x] **Frontend Tests**: AppContext and SessionService tests created
- [x] **Backend Tests**: Session endpoints and auth service tests created

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Install Test Dependencies**: 
  ```bash
  # Frontend
  cd frontend && npm install
  
  # Backend
  cd backend && pip install -r requirements-test.txt
  ```

- [ ] **Run Test Suites**:
  ```bash
  # Frontend tests
  cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
  
  # Backend tests
  cd backend && pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
  ```

- [ ] **Achieve Minimum Coverage**: Target 70% code coverage

## 🏗️ Architecture & Performance

### ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Next.js App Router**: Partially implemented (directory structure exists)
- [x] **API Routes**: Proper API route structure in place

### 🔄 NEEDS COMPLETION
- [ ] **Complete Router Migration**: Remove `activeTab` state usage for navigation
- [ ] **Background Task Queue**: Implement for heavy operations
- [ ] **Database Optimization**: Add proper indexing and query optimization

## 🔐 Additional Security Enhancements

### 🔄 RECOMMENDED
- [ ] **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement TOTP-based 2FA
- [ ] **Enhanced Password Validation**: Implement stronger password requirements
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Verify all security headers are properly set
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Audit and secure all environment variables

## 🚀 Deployment Preparation

### 📋 ENVIRONMENT SETUP
- [ ] **Production Environment Variables**:
  ```env
  # Required for production
  SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
  JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-production-jwt-secret
  DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
  REDIS_URL=your-production-redis-url
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
  
  # Optional but recommended
  RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
  RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60
  SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600
  ```

- [ ] **Database Setup**:
  - [ ] Production database configured
  - [ ] Database migrations applied
  - [ ] Database backups configured

- [ ] **Redis Setup**:
  - [ ] Production Redis instance configured
  - [ ] Redis persistence configured
  - [ ] Redis security configured

### 🔍 FINAL VERIFICATION
- [ ] **Security Scan**: Run security vulnerability scan
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load testing completed
- [ ] **Error Handling**: All error scenarios tested
- [ ] **Logging**: Comprehensive logging implemented
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Application monitoring setup

## 📊 Current Status Summary

| Category | Progress | Critical Issues |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Security** | 80% | Local storage migration |
| **Testing** | 60% | Test execution needed |
| **Architecture** | 70% | Background tasks missing |
| **Deployment** | 30% | Environment setup needed |

## 🎯 Priority Actions (Next 24-48 Hours)

### 1. **IMMEDIATE (Today)**
- [ ] Test and verify session service integration
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suites
- [ ] Fix any failing tests

### 2. **HIGH PRIORITY (Tomorrow)**
- [ ] Complete localStorage to session migration
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure production database and Redis

### 3. **BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**
- [ ] Achieve minimum test coverage (70%)
- [ ] Complete security audit
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Documentation review

## 🚨 Deployment Blockers

**DO NOT DEPLOY UNTIL THESE ARE RESOLVED:**

1. **Session Security**: Ensure all sensitive data is moved from localStorage
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 70% test coverage achieved
3. **Environment Security**: All production secrets properly configured
4. **Database Security**: Production database properly secured

## 📞 Emergency Contacts

- **Security Issues**: Review `SECURITY.md` for reporting procedures
- **Technical Issues**: Check `SECURITY_SUMMARY.md` for implemented features
