## 🤝 Simple Agent Discussion

### How the Chatroom Works

User asks a financial question → All 3 agents respond with their perspective → System synthesizes into final recommendation

**Example User Question**: "Should I invest my ₹2L bonus?"

**Agent Discussion**:
- **Past Agent**: "Your MF investments returned 12% last year vs FD's 6%"
- **Present Agent**: "You have ₹50k emergency fund, can take some risk"  
- **Future Agent**: "For 10-year retirement goal, MFs align better"
- **Final Consensus**: "Invest ₹1.5L in balanced MFs, ₹50k in liquid funds"
